       <p class="battle"> In a game, you’ll face off against an opponent with a force which could 
        be a couple of units or a sprawling army. In a given turn you will pick units to move, cast spells,
        charge and attack with, using rulers and dice to measure distances and successes. In most games you’ll
        be using a battle plan to organise your fighting over objectives, enacting command abilities at clutch
         moments to turn the tide of battle..</p>

          <p class="rules">The core rules are available to download for free, as are each unit’s warscrolls. <br> 
            Ideal if you just want to throw your freshly-built units on a table and play a quick skirmish game.

    <p class="ourbattle"> In our game there was 3 armies, Death, Chaos and Destruction. To start the game we 
      each rolled a dice to decide who will be placing their army down first. <br>
      We had to split the play time of the battle as the first half was reaching the 2 and a half hours mark.
      And played the rest of the battle the next day which took another 3 hours to finish, resulting in my Death army winning :).
