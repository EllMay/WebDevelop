<p class="orderinfo">The Grand Alliance of Order are the armies of heroes seeking to reclaim the Mortal Realms from 
    Chaos and restored to their former glory. <br> Order is a loose alliance of the free peoples of the realms – humans, 
    aelves and duardin, alongside staunch defenders of law like Sigmar’s Stormcast Eternals, more exotic forces including 
    Alarielle’s Sylvaneth and the mysterious Seraphon, as well as more sinister forces with their own goals and agendas, 
    such as the Daughters of Khaine and Idoneth Deepkin.</p>

<br>
<p class="deathinfo">The Grand Alliance of Death are the armies of undead and mortals that follow the dark commands of Nagash, 
    the Supreme Lord of the Undead. Their purpose is to kill the living imposing the order of the dead upon all the mortal realms,
     and not just Shyish, the Realm of Death.<br> These armies are numberless, brought to undeath from tombs to the corpse-mounds of 
     ancient battles. All types of undead creatures can be found under his service like the skeletal Deathrattle warriors, 
     the rotting corpses of Deadwalkers and the spectral wraiths and shades that haunt the realms.</p>

<br>
<p class="chaosinfo"> The Gods of Chaos are primeval forces dedicated to conquering not just the Mortal Realms,
     but reality itself. From the Realm of Chaos, the gods Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle and Slaanesh send forth their daemonic legions,
      <br> as their herald in the realms, Archaon the Everchosen, leads vast armies of corrupted mortals. Meanwhile, 
      the rat-like skaven infest the realms, pursuing their own nefarious goals.</p>

<br>
        <p class="destructioninfo">The forces of Destruction plunge headlong into battle at the slightest provocation. 
            Hordes of green-skinned orruks and grots, migratory tribes of brutal ogors and mighty beasts such as the 
            towering gargants seek only to bring ruin to all and sate their primal need for violence.</p>
