        <p class="mainpage1"> Age of Sigmar is a tabletop miniature
            wargame that simulates battle between armies,
            which consist of Orcs, Elves, Ogres, Humans and
            Goblins. Two players will face off against armies of
            20 to 200+.<br>
            You can play the game in different ways, some play
            very competitively, some have a storyline behind
            the figures and some just have a go-to get a taste.</p>

        <p class="mainpage2">There are 3 different ways to play; Open play, Narratvie play and Matched play.
            <br>Open play is when not all the rules are followed and the players just have fun with the battle.<br>
            Narrative play is whatever story the players want to replicate usually in the style of many role playing games.
            Matched play is the main way players use.<br> These matches use a point base system scoring each army usually
            around 2000 points, each figure is worth a certain amount of points
